=========

Interfacing an XBOX Kinect with an Arduino Uno to track hand and finger movements and to translate this into a robotic arm and hands.

A senior project of Henry Robalino, Harsh Mehta, Timothy Tham.


Current Progress:

test_fingers_ino so far is the best file that is able to move one of the servo's. If two servo's are attached it will not move any servo at all, but if one is attached then it will move that one servo but it must also be in the 0 spot. Must fix that bug.
