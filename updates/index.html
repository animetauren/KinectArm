        4-15-13: Today we got the Arduino working with the I2C and the servo multiplexing. Getting the max and min frequencies tuned to the correct level output for approx 180 degree. Now working on translating the code from Arduino Servo to I2C. Hopefully this can be accomplished today!

        4-9-13: Today we finally started spending some time working on the Processing side of the code, got it compile and detect the Kinect as well as output the display from the Kinect and track the fingers as they were detected by the Kinect. This is a good step forward as we now have a foot inside the door of our project which is to detect the fingers, for the next meeting we hope to update the code and translate the movement of the heads to movements in the Arduino and servo motors using Arduino C.
